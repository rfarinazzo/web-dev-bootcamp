<h2>Coming up with my favorite movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>Definitely the best movie ever. Dialogues are so powerful and it teaches us so much.</p>
<h3>THe Patriot</h3>
<p>It's inspiring to see a man fighting for what he believes, going through pain and sacrifice to make it happen.</p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>Honor. Family. Duty. And how we can justify the worst acts using the greatest values.</p>
